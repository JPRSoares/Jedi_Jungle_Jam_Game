Jedi Jungle Jam is an collaborative project I developed with four colleagues during my initial three weeks of learning Java. Using only a simple library, Simple Graphics, we created an engaging endless runner game.

In this game, players navigate through a jungle environment, imagining the daily routine of a Jedi. 

One of the unique features of Jedi Jungle Jam is the incorporation of voice clips that reflect both player performance and the game's design philosophy.

Challenges Overcame:

Adding and Controlling Movement: Implementing smooth and responsive movement mechanics required understanding and manipulating Java's graphical library.
Controlling Collisions: Accurate collision detection was essential .
Managing Threads: Handling concurrent processes.
